# AiZynthFinder Research Project

## Abstract

**Retrosynthetic analysis** and **reaction prediction** are fundamental for efficient chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Consequently, **computer assisted synthesis prediction** (**CASP**) tools have been at the forefront of research and development, striving to **computationally identify** the **optimal sequence of chemical reaction steps** that transform **commercially viable starting materials** into **desired chemical compounds**. <sup>**1**</sup> 

A leading CASP tool, **AiZynthFinder**, achieves retrosynthesis prediction by generating a **retrosynthetic search tree** using a **template-based, feedforward neural network (FNN) model**, known as the **expansion policy**, to give a **ranked list of reaction templates**. This process is followed by a **another neural network**, the **filter policy**, which **removes unfeasible reactions**. Once the retrosynthesis search tree is constructed, a **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm** **traverses the search tree** to **identify the best synthetic routes**.

This study focuses enhancing AiZynthFinder by integrating **SMILES-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)** and **transformer** models into its **expansion policy**. By leveraging these advanced neural network architectures with **SMILES-based chemical representations**, we aim to overcome the inherent limitations of template-based retrosynthetic methods. The integration seeks to **broaden accurate predictions beyond the rule-based knowledge base**, ensure that predictions **consider the entire molecular environment**, and **account for stereochemistry**.

**AiZynthFinder** is a **computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP)** tool developed by **AstraZeneca's MolecularAI department**. Specifically, it is a **computer-assisted synthesis prediction tool** that seeks to identify the **optimal sequence of chemical reaction steps** capable of transforming a set of **commercially available starting materials** into a **desired chemical compound**. **<sup>1</sup>**  **<sup>2</sup>**

AiZynthFinder leverages recent advancements in **machine learning techniques**, specifically **deep neural networks**, to **predict synthetic pathways via retrosynthetic analysis** with **minimal human intervention**. **<sup>1</sup>**  **<sup>3</sup>**

## 1.1 Basics of Retrosynthesis 

**Retrosynthetic analysis** involves the **deconstruction of a target molecule** into **simpler precursor structures** in order to **probe different synthetic routes** to the target molecule and **compare the different routes** in terms of synthetic viability.

Retrosynthesis involves:
1. **Disconnection**:
   * The **breaking of a chemical bond** to give a **possible starting material**. This can be thought of as the reverse of a synthetic reaction.

  </div>
<br>

2. **Synthons**:
   * These are the **fragments produced by the disconnection**.
   * Usually, a single bond disconnection will give a **negatively charged, nucleophilic synthon**, and a **positively charged, electrophilic synthon**.
<br>

  </div>
<br>

   * However, other times the disconnection will give **neutral fragments**. Classical examples of this are **pericyclic reactions**, such as **Diels-Alder reactions**.
<br>

  </div>
<br>

3. **Synthetic Equivalients**:
   * Synthons are not species that exist in reality due to their **reactivity**, and so a synthetic equivalent is a **reagent carrying out the function of a synthon** in the synthesis.
<br>

4. **Functional Group Interconversion (FGI)**:
   * If a **disconnection is not possible** at a given site, **FGI can be used**.
   * An FGI is an operation whereby **one functional group is converted into another** so that a **disconnection becomes possible**.
   * A common FGI is the **oxidation of an alcohol to a carbonyl, or amine to nitro group**

<br>
     
5. **Functional Group Addition (FGA)**:
   * Similar to FGI, **FGA** is the **addition of a functional group to another** to make it **suitable for disconnection**.

## 1.2 Retrosynthetic Search Tree

Typically, the retrosynthetic analysis of a target molecule is an **iterative process** whereby the **subsequent fragments are themselves broken down** until we **reach a stop criterion**. This stop criterion is typically when we reach **precursors that are commercially available/in stock**.

<br>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb4d5580-028b-4610-b95e-8b2f4fc234ba", alt="retrosynthetic-tree"/>
    <p>
      <b>Fig 6</b> Chemical representation of a retrosynthesis search tree. <b><sup>4</sup></b>
    </p>
  </div>
<br>

This iterative process results in a **retrosynthesis tree** where the **breadth is incredibly large**, but the **depth is quite small/shallow**. In comparison to the search trees for games such as chess and Go (**Fig 6**), the **breadth of a retrosynthesis search tree is incredibly large** because you could **theoretically break any bonds** in the target molecule, and the subsequent fragments. This leads to an **explosion in child nodes** from the **first few subtrees**.

The **depth** of a retrosynthesis search tree is **small/shallow** on the other hand, as it only takes a **few disconnections before viable precursors are found**. This is ideal since we don't want **linear synthetic reactions** with an **excessive number of steps**.

<br>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c3efa40-bf2c-4124-bd13-4ad9f5a5d6b0", alt="retrosynthetic-search-tree-breadth-depth"/>
    <p>

    </p>
  </div>
<br>

For **effective retrosynthetic analysis**, a retrosynthesis program must:
1. **Define the disconnection rules clearly and efficiently** in order to **reduce the breadth** of the retrosynthesis search tree.
2. **Traverse the retrosynthesis search tree efficiently** using an **effective search algorithm**.

### 1.3 AiZynthFinder Template-Based Retrosynthesis Model (Define Disconnection Rules)

AiZynthFinder uses a **template-based retrosynthesis model** to **define the disconnection rules**. This approach utilises a **curated database** of **transformation rules** that are **extracted from external reaction databases** that are then **encoded computationally into reaction templates** as **SMIRKS**. 
* **SMIRKS** is a form of **linear notation** used for **molecular reaction representation**. It was developed by **Daylight** and can be thought of as a hybrid between **SMILES** and **SMARTS**.

These reaction templates can then be used as the **disconnection rules** for decomposing the target molecule into simpler, commercially available precursors.

However, before they are used, AiZynthFinder uses a **simple neural network (Expansion policy)** to **predict the probability for each template given a molecule** **<sup>6</sup>** (**Fig 8**).

<br>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e60a52c-d9b1-474d-ad72-faf6f8592626", alt="aizynthfinder-template-neural-network"/>
    <p>
      <b>Fig 8</b> Reaction template ranking using Expansion policy neural network. <b><sup>5</sup></b>
    </p>
  </div>
<br>

This **expansion policy neural network template ranking** works as follows:
1. **Encoding of query molecule/target molecule**: The query molecule/target molecule is encoded as an **extended-connectivity fingerprint (ECFP) bit string**, **<sup>7</sup>** specifically an **ECFP4 bit string**.
2. **Expansion policy neural network**: The ECFP4 fingerprints are then **fed into a simple neural network**, called an **expansion policy**. The **output of this neural network** is a **ranked list of templates**.
3. **Keep top-ranked templates and apply to target molecule**: The top-ranked templates are kept (typically the **top 50**), and are **applied to the target molecule**, producing **different sets of precursors**

However, the expansion policy **doesn't know much about chemistry** and **doesn't take all of the reaction environment into consideration**. As a result, it can **rank unfeasible reactions highly**.

Therefore, AiZynthFinder has **another trained neural network** called **filter policy** that is used to **filter and remove unfeasible reactions** (**Fig 9**). **<sup>8</sup>**

<br>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ab97b1a-54b8-48cd-bd46-2f32c74d82b0", alt="aizynthfinder-neural-network-reaction-filter"/>

## 1.4 Monte Carlo Tree Search: Finding the Best Routes (Traverse the Retrosynthesis Search Tree Efficiently)

### 1.4.1 Heuristic Search Algorithms

**Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** **<sup>9</sup>** is a powerful search algorithm that uses **heuristics** (i.e., **rules of thumb**) for **decision-making processes**, particularly in **complex search spaces**.

  * Like with other **heuristic search algorithms**, the goal of MCTS is to **find a good enough solution within a reasonable amount of time**, rather than **guaranteeing the optimal solution** by **examining all possible outcomes**.
  * Heuristic search algorithms like MCTS are guided by a **heuristic function**, which is a mathematical function used to estimate the **cost, distance or likelihood of reaching the goal from a given state or node**. This function helps **prioritse which paths or options to explore**, based on their likelihood of **leading to an optimal or near-optimal solution**.
  * Heuristic search algorithms aim to **reduce the search space**, making them **more efficient than exhaustive search methods**. By **focusing on promising paths**, they can often **find solutions faster**, especially in complex or large problem spaces. Although these solutions **may not be optimal**, they are **usually good enough for practical purposes**.

### 1.4.2 Monte Carlo Tree Search in AiZynthFinder

In AiZynthFinder, MCTS plays a crucial role in **effectively navigating the vast search space of possible synthetic routes** to find the **best synthesis pathway** for a target molecule.

To recap, the **retrosynthesis tree structure representation** consists of:
* **Nodes**: Each node in the tree represents **a state of the retrosynthesis problem**. In AiZynthFinder, a node corresponds to **a set of one or more intermediate molecules** that can be used to **synthesise the molecule(s)** in the **current node's parent node**.
* **Edges**: The edges between the nodes represent the **application of a specific reaction template (disconnection rule)** to **decompose the molecule set in the parent node** into **simpler precursor molecules in the child node**.

In AiZynthFinder, MCTS uses **iterative/sequential Monte Carlo simulations** **<sup>10</sup>** to explore potential synthetic routes as follows:

**1. Selection**
* Starting at the **root node** (target molecule), the MCTS algorithm selects the **most promising node for expansion** based on a balance of **exploration (trying new reactions)**, and **exploitation (further exploring known good reactions)**
* This is governed by a **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) score formula** (**Fig 10**) and is how AiZynthFinder **selects and scores routes**.

<br>
  <div align="center">

    </p>
  </div>
<br>

**2. Expansion**
* Once a node has been selected, the MCTS algorithm **expands it** by applying a **new reaction template** from the **expansion policy** and **filter policy**, generating **new precursor molecules** (i.e., **new child nodes**).
* At **each expansion step**, the **expansion policy and filter policy** are used to **filter out unfeasible reactions**, ensuring that the search **focuses on viable synthetic routes**.

**3. Rollout/Iteration**
* This process of **selection and expansion** is then **repeated for each resulting precursor molecule** until the **stop criterion is met** and we reach a **terminal node**.
* The stop criterion is usually either when the search reaches **commercially available precursors**, or when it reaches a **pre-defined tree depth/number of disconnections**.

**4. Update/Backpropagation**
* Once the **terminal node is reached**, the **Monte Carlo simulation** is complete and a **complete synthetic route is generated**. This completed simulation/synthetic route is known as a **playout**.
* The **score of the terminal node** (and hence the **score of the playout/synthetic route**) is then **propagated up through the tree**.
* This score of the terminal node is the **accumulated reward (Q)** in the **UCB Score formula** (**Fig 10**), which is a function of the **tree depth** at the terminal node (i.e., **how many synthesis steps** between it and the target molecule), and the **fraction of the precursor molecules in that route that are in stock**.
* This gives a quantitative analysis of the **quality of the synthetic route**.

Steps 1 - 4 are then repeated in **iterative Monte Carlo simulations**. The number of iterations is governed by a **predefined limit**, or a **predefined search time**. This iterative process is illustrated in **Fig 11**.

## 1.5 AiZynthFinder Post-Processing Tools - Route Scoring

AiZynthFinder also uses a number of **scoring algorithms** to **score routes during post-processing** (**Fig 12**).

<br>

## 1.6 Route Clustering

AiZynthFinder also has the ability to **cluster routes** in order to perform a **cluster analysis** via **hierarchical clustering**. **<sup>11</sup>**

The specific type of hierarchical clustering that AiZynthFinder uses is **agglomerative ("bottom-up") hierarchical clustering** **<sup>9</sup>**. This involves:
1. Creating a **dendrogram** (a common visualisation tookit from the `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` package), to represent the **hierarchy of clusters of routes formed at different levels of distance**.
2. Using a **linkage matrix** (`linkage_matrix`) to  **calculate the Euclidean distance between the clusters** at **each step of the clustering process**. This gives a **measure of similarity or dissimilarity** between the clusters of routes. This `linkage_matrix` is generated by the `ClusterHelper` class, which uses the agglomerative clustering algorithm implemented in **scikit-learn**
