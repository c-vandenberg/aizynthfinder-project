## Retrosynthesis with AiZynthFinder - Overview

**Retrosynthetic analysis** involves the **deconstruction of a target molecule** into **simpler precursor structures** in order to **probe different synthetic routes** to the target molecule and **compare the different routes** in terms of synthetic viability.

Retrosynthesis involves:
1. **Disconnection**: The **breaking of a chemical bond** to give a **possible starting material**. This can be thought of as the reverse of a synthetic reaction.
2. **Synthons**: These are the **fragments produced by the disconnection**. Usually, a single bond disconnection will give a **negatively charged, nucleophilic synthon**, and a **positively charged, electrophilic synthon**. However, other times the disconnection will give **neutral fragments**. Classical examples of this are **pericyclic reactions** such as **Diels-Alder reactions**
3. **Synthetic Equivalients**: Synthons are not species that exist in reality due to their **reactivity**, and so a synthetic equivalent is a **reagent carrying out the function of a synthon** in the synthesis.
4. **FGI and FGA**: If a **disconnection is not possible** at a given site, two strategies are:
   * **FGI (Functional Group Interconversion)** - This is an operation whereby **one functional group is converted into another** so that a **disconnection becomes possible**. A common FGI is the **oxidation of an alcohol to a carbonyl**.
   * **FGA (Functional Group Addition)** -  This is the **addition of a functional group to another** to make it **suitable for disconnection**.
