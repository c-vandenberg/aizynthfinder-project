### 1.1.1 Basics of Retrosynthesis 

**Retrosynthetic analysis** involves the **deconstruction of a target molecule** into **simpler precursor structures** in order to **probe different synthetic routes** to the target molecule and **compare the different routes** in terms of synthetic viability.

Retrosynthesis involves:
1. **Disconnection**: The **breaking of a chemical bond** to give a **possible starting material**. This can be thought of as the reverse of a synthetic reaction.

2. **Synthons**: These are the **fragments produced by the disconnection**. Usually, a single bond disconnection will give a **negatively charged, nucleophilic synthon**, and a **positively charged, electrophilic synthon**. However, other times the disconnection will give **neutral fragments**. Classical examples of this are **pericyclic reactions** such as **Diels-Alder reactions**.

4. **Synthetic Equivalients**: Synthons are not species that exist in reality due to their **reactivity**, and so a synthetic equivalent is a **reagent carrying out the function of a synthon** in the synthesis.
<br>

5. **Functional Group Interconversion (FGI)**: If a **disconnection is not possible** at a given site, **FGI can be used**. FGI is an operation whereby **one functional group is converted into another** so that a **disconnection becomes possible**. A common FGI is the **oxidation of an alcohol to a carbonyl, or amine to nitro group**

6. **Functional Group Addition (FGA)**: Similar to FGI, **FGA** is the **addition of a functional group to another** to make it **suitable for disconnection**.
